<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Hydraulic Fluid for Metallurgy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HFA</li><li>HFB</li><li>HFC</li><li>HFD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant hydraulic fluids in metallurgy are classified into four main types: HFA, HFB, HFC, and HFD. HFA fluids are water-containing fluids, providing excellent fire resistance, while HFB fluids are oil-based with a small percentage of water, offering moderate fire safety. HFC fluids are water-containing fluids but are less flammable than HFA, making them suitable for high-temperature applications. HFD fluids are non-water-containing and specifically formulated to resist ignition, ideal for extreme environments. Each type is tailored for specific operational needs and safety standards in metallurgy.</p></p>
