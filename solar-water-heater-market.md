<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized Solar Water Heater</li><li>Non Pressure Solar Water Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar water heater market is primarily divided into two types: pressurized and non-pressurized systems. Pressurized solar water heaters use a closed-loop system that maintains consistent water pressure, making them suitable for high-rise buildings and larger households. They are more efficient in colder climates. Conversely, non-pressurized solar water heaters rely on gravity and do not maintain pressure, making them simpler and more cost-effective, but less suitable for taller installations. Both types harness solar energy for eco-friendly water heating solutions.</p></p>
