<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axle Counter for Train Detection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rail Side Axle Counter</li><li>On-rail Axle Counter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The train detection market features two primary types of axle counters: rail side axle counters and on-rail axle counters. Rail side axle counters are installed alongside the track, using sensors to monitor train passage and count axles as they pass. On-rail axle counters, on the other hand, are mounted directly on the train itself, providing real-time data on axle configuration and movement. Both systems enhance safety and efficiency in rail operations by ensuring accurate train detection and tracking.</p></p>
