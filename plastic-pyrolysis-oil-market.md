<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Pyrolysis Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fast Pyrolysis</li><li>Flash Pyrolysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic pyrolysis oil market consists primarily of fast pyrolysis and flash pyrolysis processes. Fast pyrolysis involves heating plastic waste rapidly to produce liquid oil, gases, and char, typically at moderate temperatures and longer residence times, making it suitable for producing consistent oil quality. Flash pyrolysis, on the other hand, utilizes extremely rapid heating at higher temperatures, leading to quick conversion and higher yields of vapor, which can be condensed into oil. Both methods offer sustainable alternatives for plastic waste management.</p></p>
